Taints and Tolerations are used to set restrictions on what pods can be scheduled on a node.
Only pods which are tolerant to the particular taint on a node will get scheduled on that node.


## Installation of 'kind' cluster
https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation

### Mac
```bash
brew install kind
```

### Linux
```bash
curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.17.0/kind-linux-amd64
chmod +x ./kind
sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind
```

### start kind k8s cluster
```bash
kind create cluster
kubectl cluster-info
```

### Use kubectl taint nodes command to taint a node.

Syntax
```bash
$ kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key=value:taint-effect
```

### Let's taint the node1 with app=blue:NoSchedule

```bash
$ kubectl taint nodes node1 app=blue:NoSchedule
```

### Adding the toleration

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: myapp-pod
spec:
 containers:
 - name: nginx-container
   image: nginx
 tolerations:
 - key: "app"
   operator: "Equal"
   value: "blue"
   effect: "NoSchedule"
```

### Checking the pod scheduled on node with 'app=blue:NoSchedule' taint

```bash
$ kubectl describe pod myapp-pod
$ kubectl get pod myapp-pod -o wide
```

## Nodes with Special Hardware

What if you require special hardware for your nodes? For example, how can you prevent pods that donâ€™t need GPU from monopolizing resources on an expensive virtual machine with specialized hardware? Taints and tolerations are the answer to this problem.


```bash
kubectl taint nodes nodename gpu=true:NoSchedule
```

The tolerations for this use case would look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: gpupod
  labels:
    env: prod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: ai-handler
    image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  tolerations:
  - key: "gpu"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "true"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```
